# 5800_final_project
k-means clustering for cs5800


Things to do next:

1. Test on other datasets, and create some functions which allow us to easily run our algorithm on these datasets (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php) 
2. Write a function which measures the "quality" of fit for a given k on a dataset in order to find the best k. 
3. Draw decision boundaries from a provide list of clusters, essentially just the voronoi tesselation (only for 2d)
4. Modify the algorithm to draw the update function at each step (only for 2d)
