# 5800_final_project
k-means clustering for cs5800


Things to do next:

1. Make it n-dimensional, rather than just working on a set of 2d points, make it work for higher dimensions! 
2. Test on other datasets, and create some functions which allow us to easily run our algorithm on these datasets
3. Write a function which measures the "quality" of fit for a given k on a dataset in order to find the best k. 
4. Draw decision boundaries from a provide list of clusters, essentially just the voronoi tesselation (only for 2d)
